/**
    A utility for using the graph query interface from a Model. Queries may be represented
    as models, where each statement in the model corresponds to a search for matching
    statements in the model being queried. Variables are represented as resources
    with URIs using the ficticious "jqv" protocol.
<p>    
    See also <code>QueryMapper</code>.
