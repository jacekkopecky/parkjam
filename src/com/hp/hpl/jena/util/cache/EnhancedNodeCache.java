/**
     EnhancedNodeCache - the cache to use for enhanced nodes (mapping a Node
     to one of the enhanced nodes it can represent).
     
     <p>The cache methods do not need to be synchronised. Java guarantees that
     access/update of reference values is atomic. The <code>get</code> method
     does a single read operation of the cache, and then checks that the
     returned element matches the key, only returning legal objects; changes
     to the cache subsequently don't affect the correctness of the result.
     
     <p>The <code>put</code> method updates the appropriate cache entry as
     a one-shot deal. gets on different slots don't matter. Gets on the same
     slot have either completed (and thus don't care about the change) or
     are about to happen (and will be equally happy with the old or new
     value).
     
     <p>Synchronisation *is* required when updating the EnhNode sibling ring,
     but that doesn't happen here.
