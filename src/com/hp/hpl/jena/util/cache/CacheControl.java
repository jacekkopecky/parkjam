/** An interface for controlling the behaviour of a cache.

 * parameters on a cache, without granting read/write access
 * to the cache itself.</p>
 *
 * <p>Cache's may be enabled or disabled.  A disabled cache
 * is a silent cache; it will silently not return objects
 * from its store and not update its store.  It will operate
 * as if the cache always missed.</p>
 *
 * <p>Cache's keep statistics on their accesses.  On a long
 * running cache the numbers may exceeed the size of the
 * variables counting the statistics, in which case, the
 * fields counting gets hits and puts are reduced
 * proportionately.</p>
