/**
    Helper class for listObjects. Because literal indexing means that the
    domain of the object map is not a node, but an indexing value (shared by
    a bunch of different literal nodes), getting the list of objects requires
    mapping that indexing value to all the triples that use it, and then
    filtering those triples for their objects, removing duplicates.
