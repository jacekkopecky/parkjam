<BODY>
<p>A general  database backend for persistent storage of Jena models. This  Jena2 release 
runs on three database engines, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL on two platforms, 
Linux and WindowsXP. The Jena2 persistence subsystem is largely compatible with 
Jena1 but does not support the various Jena1 layouts. Existing Jena1 databases 
cannot be accessed by Jena2 and must be reloaded.</p>
<p>For details on creating and accessing persistent models, see
<font face="Courier New" size="2">doc/DB/howto.html</font>. For details on 
options for configuring and accessing persistent models see the
<font size="2" face="Courier New">doc/DB/options.html</font>. For particulars on 
persistent models for the various database engines, see
<font face="Courier New" size="2">doc/DB/mysql-howto.html, doc/DB/oracle-howto.html,doc/DB/postgresql-howto.html</font>.</p>
<p>Note that the recommended mechanism for creating and opening persistent 
models has changed from Jena1 and also from the preliminary releases of Jena2. 
Previous mechanisms are now deprecated and users are encouraged to use the new 
factory mechanisms. See <font size="2" face="Courier New">doc/how-to/model-factory.html</font> 
for details.</p>
