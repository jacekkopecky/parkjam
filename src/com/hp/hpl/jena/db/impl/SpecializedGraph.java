/**
 * Interface for a specialized graph.
 * 
 * Each specialized graph is optimized for a particular type of statement.
 * 
 * An implemenation of GraphRDB will contain a list of specialized graphs
 * and will attempt to perform each operation on each specialized graph
 * in the list until one indicates the operation is complete.
 * 
 * The list of specialized graphs is immutable.  This aids optimization.
 * For example, if a specialied graph is asked to perform an operatin 
 * on a triple, and it knows that it would have added it if asked, then 
 * it can advise the calling GraphRDB that the operaton is complete even 
 * though it doesn't know anything about other specialized graphs later
 * in the list.
