/**
 *
 * A wrapper to assist in getting and setting DB information from 
 * a persistent store.
 * 
 * This is written in the style of enhanced nodes - no state is
 * stored in the DBStoreDesc, instead all state is in the
 * underlying graph and this is just provided as a convenience.
 * 
 * (We don't use enhanced nodes because, since we control everything
 * in the persistent store system description, we can avoid any
 * need to handle polymorhphism).
 * 
 * @since Jena 2.0

 * @version $Revision: 1.1 $
