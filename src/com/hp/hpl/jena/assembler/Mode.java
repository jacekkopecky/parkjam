/**
    A Mode object controls whether persistent objects can be created or reused
    by an assembler. Their methods are expected to be called when an
    assembler is about to create a new object (because no object with the given
    name exists) or reuse an existing one (because one does).
    
<p>The default behaviour of the methods is dictated by booleans bound into
    the mode object. Subclasses of mode may exploit the ability to inspect the
    name of the object or its other RDF properties.
