/**
    A NodeCache caches nodes according to their labels, to reduce store turnover
    at the expense of some additional computation. The cache is represented as an
    array indexed by the reduced hashcode of the labels of the nodes it contains.
    Only the most recent node with any given reduced hash is kept. This tactic
    means that we don't need to have any explicit cache-clearing code in normal
    oepration.
