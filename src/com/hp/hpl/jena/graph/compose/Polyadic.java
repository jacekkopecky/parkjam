/**
 * <p>
 * A base class for composition graphs that are composed from zero or more
 * sub-graphs (thus providing a basis for polyadic composition operators).
 * A distinguished graph is the designated graph for additions to the union.
 * By default, this is the first sub-graph of the composition, however any
 * of the graphs in the composition can be nominated to be the distinguished
 * graph.
 * </p>
