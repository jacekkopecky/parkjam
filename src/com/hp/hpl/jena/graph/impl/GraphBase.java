/**
    GraphBase is an implementation of Graph that provides some convenient
    base functionality for Graph implementations.
<p>
    Subtypes of GraphBase must provide performAdd(Triple), performDelete(Triple), 
    graphBaseFind(TripleMatch,TripleAction), and graphBaseSize(). GraphBase 
    provides default implementations of the other methods, including the other finds 
    (on top of that one), a simple-minded prepare, and contains. GraphBase also 
    handles the event-listening and registration interfaces.
<p>
    When a GraphBase is closed, future operations on it may throw an exception.
