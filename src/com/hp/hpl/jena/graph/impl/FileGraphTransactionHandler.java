/**
    A TransactionHandler for FileGraphs. When a FileGraph begin()s a 
    transaction, its current contents are checkpointed into a sibling file
    (whose name starts "checkPoint-"). On an abort(), the current contents 
    are discarded, and the checkpointed contents restored; on a commit(),
    the current contents are written back to the backing file, and the
    checkpoint file is deleted. Nested transactions are Not Allowed.
