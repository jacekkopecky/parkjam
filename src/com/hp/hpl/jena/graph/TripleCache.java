/**
	TripleCache caches triples according to their SPO members, to reduce store
    turnover at the expense of some added computation. The cache is implemented
    as an array indexed by the (reduced) hashCode of the triples it stores. 
    Each slot is treated independantly and only the most recent stored triple is
    remembered - there is no weighting, LRU, or anything like that.
