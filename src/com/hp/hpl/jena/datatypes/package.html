			Provides the core interfaces through which datatypes are described to Jena. Instances of RDFDatatype
                  describe serialization, parsing and equality-testing functions for a single Datatype. The TypeMapper
                  provides a user-extensible registry through which datatype definitions can be registered against URIs.
			It is prepopulated with XML datatype definitions.
