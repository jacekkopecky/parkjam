/**
 * Create or lookup an anonymous instance of a property value. Syntax of the call is:
 * <pre>
 *    makeInstance(X, P, D, T) or makeInstance(X, P, T)
 * </pre>
 * where X is the instance and P the property for which a temporary
 * value is required, T will be bound to the temp value (a bNode) and D is
 * an optional type cor the T value.
