 * Core properties of choice frames used use to represent the OR state of
 * the backtracking search. Specific variants of this need to preserve additional
 * choice state.
 * <p>
 * This is used in the inner loop of the interpreter and so is a pure data structure
 * not an abstract data type and assumes privileged access to the interpreter state.
