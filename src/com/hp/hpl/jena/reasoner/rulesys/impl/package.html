			Internal implementation objects used by the rule system interpreters			and compilers. Note that the class in here are not intended for 			general use. In particular, they are primarily stucts rather than			correctly encasulated objects (i.e. they access each other's fields			directly in some cases, instead of indirectly through accessor methods).
