/** 
 * A pure forward chaining implementation of the RDFS closure rules
 * based upon the basic forward rule interpreter. The normal mixed
 * forward/backward implementation is generally preferred but this has 
 * two possible uses. First, it is a test and demonstration of the forward
 * chainer. Second, if you want all the RDFS entailments for an entire 
 * dataset the forward chainer will be more efficient.
