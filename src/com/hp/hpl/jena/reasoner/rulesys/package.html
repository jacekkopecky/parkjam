			Provides a selection of simple rule engines for Jena inference models.
			Currently this includes a simple forward chaining engine (BasicForwardRuleReasoner).
			This is currently a pure interpreter (no RETE network) with an extensible set
			of Builtin actions (see Builtin).
	    </p><p>
	        We include two example reasoners built using this rule engine. The first is
	        an alternative RDFS implementation (RDFSRuleReasonerFactory) which implements the
	        full RDFS rule set forward style.
	    </p><p>
	        The second is an implementation of the OWL-lite subset of OWL-full (OWLRuleReasonerFactory).
	        This omits some of the RDFS entailments (everything is a Resource, every Class is a
	        subclass of Resource) because those conclusions are general not that useful and
	        lead to rather a lot of pointless deductions in forward chaining mode.
