/**
 * Implementation of InfGraph used by the TransitiveReasoner.
 * This is returned by the TransitiveReasoner when a data graph
 * (together with an optional schema) has been bound.
 * 
 * <p>The cached property and class graphs are calculated by the
 * reasoner when the schema is bound. If the data graph does not
 * include schema information then the caches generated at 
 * schema binding stage are reused here. Otherwise the caches
 * are regenerated.</p>
