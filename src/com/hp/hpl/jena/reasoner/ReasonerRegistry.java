/**
 * A global registry of known reasoner modules. Modules are identified
 * by a URI and can have associated capability and descriptive
 * information, in RDF. Currently the schema/ontology for such
 * descriptions is mostly open. However, we do ensure that each reasoner
 * URI at least has an associated rdf:type statement to indicate that it
 * is a reasoner.
 * <p>
 * It is up to each reasoner or some associated configuration system
 * to register it in this registry.  </p>
