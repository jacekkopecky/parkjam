    The interface for classes that listen for model-changed events. In all cases,
    the argument is [a copy of] the item that has been presented to the model,
    or its underlying graph, for addition or removal. For an add, the item [or parts
    of that item] may have already been present in the model; for remove, the
    item [or parts of it] need not have been absent from the item.
<p>
    NOTE that the listener is supplied with more-or-less faithful copies of the
    original items that were added to, or removed from, the model. In particular,
    graph-level updates to the model appear as statements, not triples.
