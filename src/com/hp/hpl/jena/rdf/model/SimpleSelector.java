/** 
    A general selector class for use when querying models.
 
    <p>An instance of this class is passed with query calls to models.  The model
    will use the <CODE>test</CODE> method of this class to decide whether
    a statement should be included in the selection.
    
    <p>Instances of this class can be provided with subject, predicate and object
    constraints.  If a subject, a predicate or an object are provided,
    the model implementation <b>may</b> restrict the statements that it tests
    to statements whose subject, predicate and object match those provided in
    the constructor.  This can provide for considerably more efficient
    searching.  However, the model implementation is not required to do this.
    If no subject, predicate or object are provided in
    the constructor, then all statements in the model must be tested.
 
    <p>This class is designed to be subclassed by the application, defining
    defining further selection criteria of its own by providing its own
    <CODE>selects</CODE> method.
    
    <p>A direct instance of SimpleSelector returns <code>true</code> for the
    Selector::isSimple() predicate. Instances of subclasses of SimpleSelector
    return <code>false</code>, since the only reason to have such subclasses
    is to provide a non-trivial <code>test</code> predicate or S/P/O tests other
    than equality.
 
    <p>The <CODE>test</CODE> method first verifies that a statement satisfies
    any subject, predicate or object constraints and the calls the <CODE>
    selects</CODE> method to test for any application supplied constraint.  The
    default <CODE>selects</CODE> method simply returns true.
