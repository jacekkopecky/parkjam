/** An RDFReader factory inferface.
 *
 * <p>This factory interface is slightly unusual, in that, as well as
 * creating and returning RDFReader's, it also provides methods
 * for creating a reader, invoking a read method on it and then
 * shuting it down.</p>
 *
 * <p>The factory will create an appropriate reader for the particular
 *   serialization language being read.  Predefined languages include:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>RDF/XML - default</li>
 * <li>RDF/XML-ABBREV</li>
 * <li>N-TRIPLE</li>
 * <li>N3</li>
 * </ul>
 *<p>System wide defaults for classes to use as readers for these languages
 *are defined.  These defaults may be overwridden by setting a system property
 *with a name of the form com.hp.hpl.jena.readers.<lang> to the class
 *name.</p>
