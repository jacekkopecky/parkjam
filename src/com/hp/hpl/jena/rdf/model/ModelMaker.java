/**
    A ModelMaker contains a collection of named models, methods for creating
    new models [both named and anonymous] and opening previously-named
    models, removing models, and accessing a single "default" Model for this
    Maker.
    
    <p>Additional constraints are placed on a ModelMaker as compared to its
    ancestor <code>ModelSource</code>. ModelMakers do not arbitrarily forget
    their contents - once they contain a named model, that model stays inside
    the ModelMaker until that ModelMaker goes away, and maybe for longer
    (eg if the ModelMaker fronted a database or directory). And new models
    can be added to a ModelMaker.
