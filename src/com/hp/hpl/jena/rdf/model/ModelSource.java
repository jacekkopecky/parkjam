/**
    The revised and soon-to-be-core interface for sources of models,
    typically generated from RDF descriptions.
    
    <p>ModelSources can supply models in a variety of ways.
    
    <ul>
    <li>some fresh model of the kind this ModelSource supplies
    <li>the particular model this ModelSource supplies
    <li>a named model from the collection this ModelSource supplies
    </ul>
    
    A ModelSource is free to "forget" named models if it so wishes;
    for example, it may be a discard-if-getting-full cache.
