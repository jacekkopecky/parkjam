/**
    A ModelGetter object can retrieve a Model given a URL for it. If it doesn't
    have such a Model, it returns null.
<p>
    ModelGetters are very weakly constrained. They need not contain any
    models at all; they may forget models they have just delivered; they may
    deliver different models given the same URL. They <i>are</i> constrained to
    deliver an "appropriate" model for the URL, however - whatever they return
    should be strongly related to the RDF which might, at some time or another,
    be retrieved from that URL.
