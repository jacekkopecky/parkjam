/** An RDF Statement.
 *
 * <p>A Statement is not a Resource, but can produce a ReifiedStatement
 * that represents it and from which the Statement can be recovered.</p>
 *
 * <p>A statement instance tracks which model created it, if any. All the
 * Resource components of a Statement are in the same model as the
 * Statement, if it has one, and are in no model if the Statement isn't.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface provides methods supporting typed literals.  This means
 *    that methods are provided which will translate a built in type, or an
 *    object to an RDF Literal.  This translation is done by invoking the
 *    <CODE>toString()</CODE> method of the object, or its built in equivalent.
 *    The reverse translation is also supported.  This is built in for built
 *    in types.  Factory objects, provided by the application, are used
 *    for application objects.</p>
