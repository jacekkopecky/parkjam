/**
 * <p>
 * Interface representing the ontology abstraction for a qualified minimum cardinality
 * restriction.   A qualified restriction is a DAML+OIL term for a restriction
 * with a cardinality constraint <em>and</em> a constraint that the values of
 * the restricted property must all belong to the given class.  At the current 
 * time, qualified restrictions are part of DAML+OIL, but not part of OWL.
