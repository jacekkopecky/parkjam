/**
 * <p>
 * Interface encapsulating the class of properties that are inverse functional:
 * that is, properties in which a given given range value has a unique value in
 * the domain (effectively, a key). In OWL DL and OWL Lite, an inverse functional
 * property cannot be a datatype property, whereas OWL Full does permit this
 * (see the relevant section of
 * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-ref-20040210/#InverseFunctionalProperty-def">the
 * OWL reference</a> for details). We conservatively model this in Jena by
 * having this interface extend {@link ObjectProperty}. Users who wish to represent
 * inverse functional datatype properties in OWL Full may have to switch
 * off strict checking in <code>OntModel</code> (see {@link OntModel#setStrictMode(boolean)}.
 * </p>
