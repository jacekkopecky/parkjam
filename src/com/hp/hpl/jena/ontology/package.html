			Provides a set of abstractions and convenience classes for accessing and manipluating ontologies
			represented in RDF. The two prevalent ontology languages based on RDF are 
			<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/">OWL</a> and
			<a href="http://www.daml.org">DAML+OIL</a>. Since these two languages are similar, this package
			attempts to present a common set of abstractions, parameterised by vocabularies fot the different languages.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Note:</b> this package primarily seeks to provide easy programmatic access to the terms in the ontologies. The
			ontology languages have well-defined semantics that provide entailment rules for triples not directly asserted by the
			ontology. By and large, an inference engine is needed to access these entailed triples, for which several options
			and an open architecture are provided elsewhere in Jena.
