ParkJam is built with Androjena for handling RDF data, see copyright
information below.

Androjena here was the 0.5 version (2010-12-04), tweaked to remove (hack out)
ARP, Jena IRI, ICU4J, and command-line tools, as none of that is useful to ParkJam.
Also rewrote UID so there's no GPL code around; with weaker uniqueness
guarantees.
